**Algorithm:**
```
1. Initialize empty tag list
2. For each dimension in STANDARD_TAGS:
     If subcategory matches any pattern in dimension:
       Add dimension tag to list
3. If transaction.reimbursable:
     Add "reimbursable" to list
4. Infer frequency from subcategory name
5. Merge with transaction.tags (remove duplicates)
6. Return updated transaction
```

**Rationale:** Automated tagging reduces manual effort and ensures consistency.

**Verification:** Auto-tagging unit tests (12 test cases)

---

### SR-008: Reimbursement Status Calculation
